    title: "Nathaniel Miller"
    excerpt: "*AFM Maestro (2015-)*<br>
    **Nathaniel is using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to develop accurate electromechanical measurements, test novel
    piezoelectric materials, and developing micro and nano-scale soft lithographic techniques.**
    He attended the University of Pittsburgh Greensburg, completing a B.S. in Chemistry, followed by a P.S.M. in Industrial and Applied Chemistry from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, while working in industry."

    title: "Chris Petroff"
    excerpt: "*Characterization Wizard (2015-)*<br>
    **Chris investigates piezoelectric materials using device-level electromechanical testing.**
    Chris was born and raised in Connecticut. Before coming to Pitt, he earned a B.S. in chemistry from Boston College where he spent two years researching metal-organic frameworks and nanoparticles. An avid runner, Chris ran cross country and track in high school before picking up marathoning in college; he has completed six marathons including Pittsburgh, Chicago, Berlin, and Boston"

    title: "Anneliese Schmidt"
    excerpt: "*Polymer Synthesis Pro (2017-)*<br>
    **Anneliese synthesizes polymers with the [Meyer Group](http://www.meyer-chemistry.com), designing conjugated, polarizable sequenced oligomers for high capacitance energy storage.** Anneliese received her B.S. in chemistry from the University of South Carolina Upstate, with industrial research at Milliken and Company, where she synthesized small molecules as additives to improve various polymers’ properties, e.g. toughness or permeability.  The goal of my current project is to understand how the sequence of polymer side chains affects the dielectric constant of the polymer."
