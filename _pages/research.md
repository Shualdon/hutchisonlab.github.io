Our group combines experimental and computational investigations to gain deep understanding of organic electronic materials. The bottom line is to efficiently design novel molecular materials with improved properties. Below are three areas we are currently studying in our lab.

## Molecular Piezoelectrics

Piezoelectric materials deform shape in response to an electric field and are used in everything from high-tech atomic force microscopes (AFM) to airbag impact sensors in cars. Our group is creating nanoscale piezoelectric materials with high deformation. Potential applications include energy generation and highly sensitive sensors.

## Organic Electronics

We are studying the &#8220;rational&#8221; design of novel organic solar cell materials including generating millions of candidate polymers in a computational database, combined with detailed experimental and theoretical study of charge transport. With collaborators, we are also pushing to improve nano- and microscale morphology to improve electrical conductivity.

## Charge Transport & Designer Defects

Our group is creating monolayer and nanoscale transistors with designed defects: both in terms of the type and concentration of defects. The combined experimental and computational research will enable greater understanding of charge transport in molecular materials.
