Graduate student Tamika Madison will be joining the group this summer, to focus on computational simulation of “designer defect” field-effect transistors. She brings expertise in experimental and theoretical study of gas-phase dynamics, notably Penning ionization. Tamika will be working with Dr. Marcus Hanwell and Xialing Chen.

Welcome Tamika!
