At Science 2009 (Unplugged), Dr. Hutchison was asked to give a talk about the rational design of electronic materials from the ground up.Â During the talk, he highlighted the group&#8217;s research methodology of first systematically screening conducting polymers for their potential use in electronic materials, then approaching the molecule synthetically to determine the feasibility of its creation and use in certain materials.

Great Talk!
