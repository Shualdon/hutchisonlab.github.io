This past week, the group presented two postsers at the Gordon Research Conference. The topic was Electron Donor Acceptor Interactions.

Gordon conferences &#8220;provide an international forum for the presentation and discussion of frontier research in the biological, chemical, and physical sciences, and their related technologies.&#8221;

Well done!
