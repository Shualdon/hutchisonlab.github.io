The results show that electrostatic interactions dramatically affect the field and carrier concentration dependence of charge transport in devices that include a significant number of traps, as well as its “switch-on” characteristics. Our results also show that charge transport decreases linearly as a function of neutral defect concentration as conduction pathways are turned off. For charged defects, mobility of imperfect devices is lower relative to defect-free devices but is surprisingly unaffected by the concentration of charged defects. The exact statistics of electrostatic disorder introduced by charged defects is found to obey a Poisson distribution rather than Gaussian or exponential as previously assumed. We also demonstrate that without including electrostatic interactions, simulations of transistors exhibit an unphysical negative differential resistance at higher defect levels.
