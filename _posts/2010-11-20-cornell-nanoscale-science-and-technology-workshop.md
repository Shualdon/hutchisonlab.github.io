On November 14th-16th, Dr. Hutchison spoke at the fall Simulation Workshop at the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility (CNF).

The purpose of the workshop was to bring together leading figures in nanoscience and materials simulation in order to facilitate the sharing of theoretical data in a world-wide setting. The group sought to create an international &#8220;cyber infrastructure&#8221; through which researchers could easily connect simulation results and publications. Dr. Hutchison contributed talks on his development of [Avogadro](http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/wiki/Main_Page) and [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page), both of which have made a large contribution to furthering the goals of the workshop.
