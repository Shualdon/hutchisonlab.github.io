The Hutchison group gave demos of solar cells and piezoelectric electric generation during the [Carnegie Museum of Natural History&#8217;s](http://www.carnegiemnh.org/) [&#8220;Polar Weekend,&#8221;](http://www.carnegiemnh.org/press/11-jul-sep/072711polar.htm) focusing on the science of climate change.<!--more-->The group prepared materials demonstrating organic solar cells. While our research is on polymer devices, we used fruit juices to demonstrate dye-sensitized solar cells, and homemade piezoelectric disks attached to LEDs to highlight alternative electricity generation. If you are interested in materials developed for the demo, or in having the group demo at your school or workplace, please contact us!
