Yesterday, Prof. Hutchison was a guest on [The American Entrepeneur](http://taeradio.com/) radio show, hosted by Ron Morris. He was discussing the group&#8217;s recent research on finding [optimal polymer photovoltaic materials](http://hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/2011/07/134/). You can listen to the segment [&#8220;Is a Solar-Powered Society Economically Feasible&#8221;](http://taeradio.com/episodes/archive/3326/is-a-solar-powered-society-economically-feasible/) online.
