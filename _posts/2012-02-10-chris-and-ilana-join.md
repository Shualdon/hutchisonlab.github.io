This February, graduate students Christopher Marvin and Ilana Kanal joined the Hutchison group.

Chris comes to us from South Carolina and will be working on the piezoelectric project. Ilana has lived in Pittsburgh for awhile with her husband and four children and will work on computational projects in the group.

Welcome Ilana and Chris!
