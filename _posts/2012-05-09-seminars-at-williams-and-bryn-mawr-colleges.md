Earlier this semester, Prof. Hutchison gave talks at [Williams College](http://www.williams.edu/) (his alma mater) and [Bryn Mawr](http://www.brynmawr.edu/) on work in the group. At Williams, he was named a [Class of 1960 Scholar in Chemistry](https://calendar.williams.edu/event/chemistry_department_and_class_of_1960_scholars_colloquium_8739), a program which allows the undergrad students increased interaction with visiting speakers.
