Last week, Paula presented a poster titled &#8220;Investigation of Charge Transport Dynamics via Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy&#8221; at the Gordon Research Conference in Lucca, Italy. The conference, titled [Electronic Processes in Organic Materials](http://grc.org/programs.aspx?year=2012&program=elecproc), was a great introduction into the field and she came back with helpful suggestions and feedback on the project.
