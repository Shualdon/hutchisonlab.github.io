Last week, Prof. Hutchison presented a postser on our [molecular piezoelectric](http://hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/research/molecular-springs/ "Molecular Springs") research, &#8220;Donor-Acceptor Molecule Piezoelectrics: Electromechanical Materials from the Bottom Up&#8221; at the [2012 Gordon Research Conference on Electron Donor-Acceptor Interactions](http://grc.org/programs.aspx?year=2012&program=elecdonor). The work was picked as one of the [three best posters at the conference](http://blogs.rsc.org/sc/2012/08/15/poster-prizes-awarded-at-electron-donor-acceptor-interactions/), and he gave a presentation on Thursday night in one of the coveted &#8220;poster talk&#8221; slots.
