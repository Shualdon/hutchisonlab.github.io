Today, PPG held a session titled &#8220;Young Innovator&#8217;s Showcase&#8221; where Steve, Xinfeng, and Paula presented posters on their recent work.

PPG seeks to highlight the innovator&#8217;s of tomorrow as part of their larger corporate event: Cultivate to Commercialize.

Well done everyone!
