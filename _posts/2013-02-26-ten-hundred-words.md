For [Ten Hundred Words of Science](http://tenhundredwordsofscience.tumblr.com): Explaining Complex Science in Plain English.

We make tiny things which make power from the sun and other tiny things which make power from moving. Both can help power the world.

We think hard about how matter really works and how tiny things can come together to make a whole. We try to understand how power moves through stuff. By asking how these tiny things work, and come together to form a whole, we can make them work better. So using what we learn, we make new things.

Part of our job is also to help other people to learn about these things, and how to ask and answer new questions.
