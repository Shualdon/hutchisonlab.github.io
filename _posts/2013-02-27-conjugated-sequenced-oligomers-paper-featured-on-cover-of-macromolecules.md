**Cover description**: Nature refines the properties of biopolymers, not only by composition but also by orchestration of monomer sequence. Although sequence must necessarily affect the optoelectronic properties of conjugated oligomers and copolymers, little is known about this effect, as nearly all have an alternating donor/acceptor structure. A series of _p_-phenylene−vinylene oligomers were investigated both experimentally and computationally. Despite the modest electronic variance between the monomers, HOMO−LUMO gap differences of up to 0.25 eV were observed for isomeric oligomers that differed only in sequence.
