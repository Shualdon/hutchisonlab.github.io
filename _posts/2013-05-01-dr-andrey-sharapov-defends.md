Many congratulations to Dr. Andrey Sharapov! Andrey defended his dissertation &#8220;Fast Treatment Of Pi-Stacking Using Density Functional Theory&#8221; in physics on April 8th. His dissertation involved the use of the Harris approximation in DFT for predicting pi stacking geometries in conjugated molecules, with a speed up of 10-20x over conventional methods. Congrats Andrey!
