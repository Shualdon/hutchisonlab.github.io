<p style="text-align: left;">
  The Hutchison research group in theÂ <a title="http://www.chem.pitt.edu/" href="http://www.chem.pitt.edu/">Department of Chemistry</a>Â at the <a title="http://www.pitt.edu/" href="http://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a>Â develops new materials, as well as functional microscale and nanoscale devices. We focus on building electronic materials from molecular subunits, both organic and inorganic, using a variety of techniques to rationally design the desired properties. This encompasses chemical synthesis, characterization (both physical and chemical), combined with theoretical modeling and simulation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We also develop useful open source chemistry software, including the widely-used <a href="http://avogadro.cc/">Avogadro</a> molecular editor and <a href="http://openbabel.org/">Open Babel</a>, the chemical toolbox, and the <a href="https://pqr.pitt.edu/">Pitt Quantum Repository</a>.
