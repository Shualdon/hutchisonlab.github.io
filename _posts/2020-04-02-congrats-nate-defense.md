Congratulations to Dr. Nate Miller for a successful online Ph.D. defense! (Nate was the first online-only defense in Pitt history.)

Nate will be starting a postdoc position with the [Jacobs Lab](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/JacobsLab/) in Pitt Engineering, working to connect surface features and microscopy with friction and adhesion.
