[Air Force Office of Scientific Research](http://www.wpafb.af.mil/afrl/afosr/):

The AFOSR supports scientific research that [<img class="alignleft" title="AFOSR_Shield" src="https://i2.wp.com/pre.hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/AFOSR11-300x300.jpg?resize=146%2C146" alt="" width="146" height="146" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i0.wp.com/pre.hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/AFOSR11.jpg)has the potential of benefiting both wartime and peacekeeping efforts in three distinct avenues: 1) aerospace, chemical and material sciences, 2) mathematics, information and life sciences, and 3) physics and electronics. In addition, the program supports graduate and undergraduate level education and provides unique funding opportunities through its &#8216;special programs.&#8217;
